# rcfiles

Provides a basic .vimrc and an installation script that loads the necessary plugins (for Tim Pope's Pathogen), plus configuration files for tmux etc. (work in progress).

## Installation

We assume that neither `.vimrc` nor `.vim/` exists so far.

Clone into your home folder:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/amuetter/rcfiles.git
cd rcfiles
```
Make sure you have the right permissions to execute the installation script

```
chmod u+x vimInstall.sh 
```

Run the script

```
./vimInstall.sh 
```
